- **Typography**: System fonts with proper weight hierarchy

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay
- **Tap to Collect**: Direct collection when cards fit sequences
- **Tap to Select**: Selection for strategic moves
- **Drag & Drop**: Basic drag detection (can be enhanced)
- **Visual Feedback**: Selection highlights, hover states, animations

### Difficulty Scaling
- **Easy**: 25 cards (1-5 √ó 5 colors) on 3√ó5 grid

Hard:   Base 5000 + Time Bonus (900s) + Move Bonus (150 moves)
```

## üöÄ Enhanced Features for iOS

### 1. Native Animations
- SwiftUI spring animations for card movements
- Smooth transitions between screens
- Victory celebration animations

### 2. Haptic Feedback (Optional Enhancement)
```swift
// Add to successful moves
let impactFeedback = UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .light)
impactFeedback.impactOccurred()

// Add to completion
let notificationFeedback = UINotificationFeedbackGenerator()
notificationFeedback.notificationOccurred(.success)
```

### 3. iPad Support
The current layout adapts well to iPad, but you could enhance with:
- Larger card sizes on iPad
- Side-by-side difficulty selection
- Optimized spacing for larger screens

### 4. Accessibility
- All buttons have proper labels
- Dynamic Type support
- VoiceOver compatibility

## üîß Potential Enhancements

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Enhanced Drag & Drop**: Full SwiftUI drag and drop with proper drop zones
2. **Sound Effects**: Add subtle audio feedback for moves and collection
3. **Particle Effects**: Celebration particles on collection/victory
4. **Save/Resume**: Core Data integration for game state persistence

### Advanced Features
1. **Daily Challenges**: Predetermined layouts with leaderboards
2. **Achievement System**: Unlock badges for various accomplishments
3. **Statistics Tracking**: Personal best times, average moves, etc.
4. **Theme Variations**: Alternative color schemes or card designs
5. **Multiplayer**: Turn-based or real-time competitive modes

## üìù Development Notes

### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: GameState as ObservableObject, Views as presentation layer
- **Single Source of Truth**: All game state in GameState class
- **Reactive Updates**: SwiftUI automatically updates UI when @Published properties change

### Performance
- Efficient grid rendering with LazyVGrid
- Minimal state updates to prevent unnecessary redraws
- Optimized for 60fps gameplay

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Game logic validation (card movement, collection rules)
2. **UI Tests**: User interaction flows
3. **Device Testing**: iPhone/iPad across different screen sizes

## üéØ Launch Checklist

- [ ] Test all three difficulty levels thoroughly
- [ ] Verify victory conditions work correctly
- [ ] Test undo/shuffle functionality
- [ ] Ensure proper state management (no memory leaks)
- [ ] Test on various device sizes
